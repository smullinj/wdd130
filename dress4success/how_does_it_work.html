            <p>All you need to do for this you bless your life is down load what you have.  Once that you have downloaded your geneology our program with go through and match names and their info to our data base which is connected to FamilySearch.  Once connected you will be given the option to connect with the person who has the best match of your family tree.  There you can compare trees and hopefully you are able to learn more and get unstuck.  But not only be able to get more names done but you will be able to establish a relationsip with the new family that you have been connected with.  It will help you to not only grow your tree bigger, but helps establish a strong root system for that family tree.</p>
