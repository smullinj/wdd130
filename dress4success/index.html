            <h1>We Are all Part of a Family</h1>
            <p>We are all part of the family and we have the responsibility of learn who are part of ours.  It is a difficult task at hand.  If you had experience in doing your family history, you will know how at some point you will hit a wall and can't go further without any help.  Family Tied is a site where that wall could come down.  It will not only help you continue with your family history, but could help you find and connect to those family you may not even known existed.</p>
