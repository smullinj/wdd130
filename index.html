    <p>Hello everyone, I look forward to getting to know you all better.  I am currently in the start of my third year towards getting my bachelor's degree in Applied technology.  I am not a computer wiz so I will be asking for help a lot of the time.  I am living in North Ogden, Ut with my wife (Teresa), my 6 kids (Jade 23, Colton 22, Jordyn 20, Emma 19, Carson 17, and Lynley 11).  I also have a son-in-law (Jacob), and my granddaughter (Daelynn).  I love to go camping and fishing with my boat, golfing, and hanging with the family.</p>
    <p>I have been a member my whole life and I can't imagine not being a member of this great church.  Served a full time mission to Canada Montreal Mission several years ago.  I have been divorced and then found my love of my life and got remarried.  What a blessing and from it we have Lynley my youngest daughter.</p>
    <p>I am not very good with computers and I still scratch my head everyday on why I chose this field. I am excited about learning about web design and I wasn't planning on liking it but for now it seems really cool and I love it.  But we are only in the first week.</p>
